    "description": "We want to implement a water quality sensor platform for the lake of Gui\u00e8rs in Senegal with Pharo-IoT. The data will be collected by probes. The objective is to develop tools to interact on the fly on how data is collected, aggregated and stored, as the needs of the local population evolve to provide them with co-constructed indicators on water quality.",

    "description": "This project involves creating a virtual marketplace where users can create and trade digital assets using smart contracts, with penalties for front-running or other forms of market manipulation. An algorithm could recognize when market manipulation is occurring, and the developed model will help to detect patterns of abnormal trading activities and impose punishments accordingly, such as account suspensions or financial penalties for offenders engaging in front-running practices. It also could introduce a “reputation score” feature to reward users who are more compliant with the rules and penalize those who break them. CORMAS (A platofrm for COmmon-pool Resources and Multi-Agent Simulations in Pharo) could be used to speed up developement.",

    "description": "There is a graph library in Pharo implemented within PharoAI https://github.com/pharo-ai/graph-algorithms. This library provides a user with several basic graph algorithms. Separately, a graph layouting library  has implemented basic layout algorithms https://github.com/medicka/graPharo. Redesign of these libraries and their consolidation, including adding new layout algorithms  is very significant for faster progress of different Pharo projects, especially PharoAI. Finally, we would like to implement new graph theory algorithms to add them to the library.",
